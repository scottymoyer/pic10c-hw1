# Siete y Medio 
PIC 10C Assignment 1

This program simulates a game of Siete y Medio, a Spanish card game similar to blackjack where the player tries to get as close to 7.5 without going over.  The player starts with $100 and plays against the dealer until either the player loses all their money or the dealer loses over $900.  

This program is written in C++ and consists of three files - cards.h, cards.cpp, and sieteymedio.cpp.  Cards.h contains the class and function declarations for three classes - Card, Player, and Hand.  Cards.cpp contains the definitions for these classes and functions.  Sieteymedio.cpp contains the main program for the game interface and generates a gamelog.txt file after every game. I have included two sample outputs of a win and a loss.
